> VS Code color theme for happy days

A colorful, straightforward theme based on the [fairyfloss](https://github.com/sailorhg/fairyfloss) colors.

## Development

* Press `F5` to open a new window with the extension loaded
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Inspect TM Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
